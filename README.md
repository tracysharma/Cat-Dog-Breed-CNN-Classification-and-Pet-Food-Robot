# Cat-Dog-Breed-CNN-Classification-
Welcome to this GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to demonstrating how to build a machine learning model capable of classifying cat and dog breeds. Using Python and leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we aim to provide a deep dive into the practical application of machine learning techniques in image classification. In addition, a robot package is provided which contains a simulation, and two training neural networks (at different stages of training).

# Why This Project?
As machine learning continues to revolutionise technology, its impact on image recognition has been particularly profound. This project seeks to explore this impact by focusing on a fun and relatable use case: identifying different breeds of cats and dogs. This repository aims to provide valuable insights into building and deploying a CNN-based classifier. To add, DQL is a strong method for controlling robotic systems. Through this project, we have demonstrated the use of DQL to control a robotic arm in a simple environment
