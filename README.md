# Cat-Dog-Breed-CNN-Classification-
Welcome to this GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to demonstrating how to build a machine learning model capable of classifying cat and dog breeds. Using Python and leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we aim to provide a deep dive into the practical application of machine learning techniques in image classification.

# Why This Project?
As machine learning continues to revolutionise technology, its impact on image recognition has been particularly profound. This project seeks to explore this impact by focusing on a fun and relatable use case: identifying different breeds of cats and dogs. This repository aims to provide valuable insights into building and deploying a CNN-based classifier.

# What You Will Find in This Repository
Code: Complete Python scripts using TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN.
Datasets: Links to public datasets used for training and testing the model.
Documentation: Detailed explanations of the methodology, including data preprocessing, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
Results: Analysis of the model's performance and examples of breed classification.
